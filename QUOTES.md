"Always look for the helpers! There will alway be helpers!" If you look for the helpers, you'll know there is hope. - Mr. Rogers

"The only thing worse than starting something and failing... is not starting something." - Seth Godin

    Be a lamp, or a lifeboat, or a ladder.
    Help someone's soul heal.
    Walk out of your house like a shepherd
